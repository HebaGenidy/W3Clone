I developed a **simple clone of the W3Schools website** using only core web technologies:

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3

## 📘 About the Project

This project was built as part of the frontend assignments in the ITI training program.  
The main objective was to practice building **clean, responsive, and structured web pages** without using any frameworks or external libraries.

## 💡 Key Features

- ✅ Structured layout inspired by W3Schools  
- ✅ Sections styled to look like tutorials and code samples  
- ✅ No JavaScript – only HTML & CSS  
- ✅ Clean and organized code and folder structure

## 📂 What I Gained

- 🛠️ Strengthened my frontend development foundations

- 🧠 Gained a deeper understanding of how professional websites are structured

## 👩‍💻 Final Words

This project is a small step on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer —  
and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far!
